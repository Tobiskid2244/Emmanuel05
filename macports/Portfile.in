description         PLUMED is a plugin for molecular dynamics
long_description    PLUMED is a plugin for molecular dynamics that can be used \
                    in combination with popular molecular dynamics codes to perform biased simulations. \
                    Additionally, it can be used as a standalone tool to analyze trajectories.
