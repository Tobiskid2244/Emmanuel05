## Version 2.10 (under development)

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.10

- Changes relevant for users:
  - **PLUMED 2.10 requires a C++17 compatible compiler**.
  - It is now possible to use an embedded Python interpreter to implement collective variables and functions in Python. This is largely based on a previous implementation by Toni Giorgino
    that is described in [this paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01773) and has been integrated in PLUMED by Daniele Rapetti. This feature is provided as a separate plugin
    that can be linked against the proper Python interpreter and loaded at runtime with \ref LOAD. Documentation about how to install and use this feature can be found in directory
    `plugins/pycv`.
  - A prototype of the \ref COORDINATION collective variable with limited functionalities is now included in a CUDA implementation which is orders of magnitude faster
    when using large groups. This implementation has been contributed by Daniele Rapetti and is provided as a separate plugin
    that can be linked against the proper CUDA libraries and loaded at runtime with \ref LOAD. Documentation about how to install and use this feature can be found in directory
    `plugins/cudaCoord`.

- Changes relevant for developers:
  - Removed some shortcuts for `ActionRegister.h` (from the modules bias colvar function sasa and vatom) and `CLToolRegister.h` (from the module cltools), now the two headers can only be included with `#include "core/ActionRegister.h"` or `#include "core/CLToolRegister.h"`.
  - `plumed mklib` can now process more than one cpp file. Files are combined in a single library.
  - When loading PLUMED at runtime using PLUMED_KERNEL, plumed is loaded with `RTLD_LOCAL` by default. This facilitates running multiple PLUMED versions, e.g. for \ref benchmark.
  - On Linux, `plumed-runtime` executable can now find a working libplumedKernel.so by looking in the `dlopen` path (including `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and stored RPATH).
    On MacOS, `plumed-runtime` executable can now find a working libplumedKernel.dylib by using a relative rpath.
    These changes should make this executable as functional as the normal `plumed` executable but with the advantage of loading symbols in a local namespace (see above).
  - A new \ref benchmark tool has been added to time execution of sample input files and facilitate the comparison across multiple PLUMED versions.
