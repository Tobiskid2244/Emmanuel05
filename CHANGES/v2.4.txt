@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.4

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - A c++11 compliant compiler is required (see \issue{212}). This should mean:
    - gcc 4.8
    - clang 3.3
    - intel 15
    Since the number of c++11 features that we use is limited, older compilers might work as well.
- The meaning of BIASFACTOR=1 in \ref METAD has been modified and can now be used to indicate unbiased
  simulations. Non-well-tempered metadynamics is BIASFACTOR=-1, which is the new default value.
  Notice that this has an implication on the biasfactor written in the HILLS file when doing
  non-well-tempered metadynamics.
- New modules:
  - A new EDS module have been included, contributed by Glen Hocky and Andrew White.
    This module implements the following methods:
    - \ref EDS
- New collective variables:
  -  \ref DIMER (thanks to Marco Nava).
- Other changes:
  - \ref PBMETAD : multiple walkers using files (thanks to Marco De La Pierre).
  - \ref PBMETAD : adaptive gaussians
  - \ref PBMETAD : default names for GRID and FILE (usefull with many collective variables) 
  - \ref IMPLICIT : EEF1-SB implicit solvent solvation energy
  - \ref METAD : BIASFACTOR=1 is allowed and performs unbiased sampling. HILLS file can be used
    to recover free energy also in this case.
  - PDB files with more than 100k atoms can now be read using [hybrid 36](http://cci.lbl.gov/hybrid_36/) format,
    see \issue{226}.
  - Trajectories read in \ref driver also support the usual replica convention, that is if
    trajectory with replica suffix is not found the driver will look for a trajectory without the replica suffix.
  - Internal molfile implementation has been updated to VMD 1.9.3.
  - Examples in the documentation now have syntax highlighting and links to the documentation of used actions.
  - \ref COORDINATIONNUMBER : Added option to have pairwise distance moments of coordination number in the multicolvar module

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for developers:
  - A few fixes has been made to improve exception safety. Although we still cannot declare
    PLUMED totally exception safe (there are still many non-safe pointers around),
    this made it possible to add a regtest that actually tests erroneous cmd strings
    and erroneous inputs.
  - Due to the required c++11 support, travis-ci test on Ubuntu Precise has been removed.
  - `gettimeofdate` and `gettime` have been replaced with portable `chrono` classes introduced in c++11.
