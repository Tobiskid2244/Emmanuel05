//+PLUMEDOC COLVAR ADAPTIVE_PATH
/*
Compute path collective variables that adapt to the lowest free energy path connecting states A and B.

The Path Collective Variables developed by Branduardi and co-workers \cite brand07 allow one
to compute the progress along a high-dimensional path and the distance from the high-dimensional
path.  The progress along the path (s) is computed using:

\f[
s = i_2 + \textrm{sign}(i_2-i_1) \frac{ \sqrt{( \mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_2 )^2 - |\mathbf{v}_3|^2(|\mathbf{v}_1|^2 - |\mathbf{v}_2|^2) } }{2|\mathbf{v}_3|^2} - \frac{\mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_3 - |\mathbf{v}_3|^2}{2|\mathbf{v}_3|^2}
\f]

In this expression \f$\mathbf{v}_1\f$ and \f$\mathbf{v}_3\f$ are the vectors connecting the current position to the closest and second closest node of the path,
respectfully and \f$i_1\f$ and \f$i_2\f$ are the projections of the closest and second closest frames of the path. \f$\mathbf{v}_2\f$, meanwhile, is the
vector connecting the closest frame to the second closest frame.  The distance from the path, \f$z\f$ is calculated using:

\f[
z = \sqrt{ \left[ |\mathbf{v}_1|^2 - |\mathbf{v}_2| \left( \frac{ \sqrt{( \mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_2 )^2 - |\mathbf{v}_3|^2(|\mathbf{v}_1|^2 - |\mathbf{v}_2|^2) } }{2|\mathbf{v}_3|^2} - \frac{\mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_3 - |\mathbf{v}_3|^2}{2|\mathbf{v}_3|^2} \right) \right]^2 }
\f]

Notice that these are the definitions of \f$s\f$ and \f$z\f$ that are used by \ref PATH when the GPATH option is employed.  The reason for this is that
the adaptive path method implemented in this action was inspired by the work of Diaz and Ensing in which these formula were used \cite BerndAdaptivePath.
To learn more about how the path is adapted we strongly recommend reading this paper.

\par Examples

The input below provides an example that shows how the adaptive path works. The path is updated every 50 steps of
MD based on the data accumulated during the preceding 50 time steps.

\plumedfile
d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2 COMPONENTS
pp: ADAPTIVE_PATH TYPE=EUCLIDEAN FIXED=5,15 UPDATE=50 WFILE=out-path.pdb WSTRIDE=50 REFERENCE=mypath.pdb
PRINT ARG=d1.x,d1.y,pp.* FILE=colvar
\endplumedfile

In the case above the distance between frames is calculated based on the \f$x\f$ and \f$y\f$ components of the vector connecting
atoms 1 and 2.  As such an extract from the input reference path (mypath.pdb) would look as follows:

\verbatim
REMARK ARG=d1.x,d1.y d1.x=1.12 d1.y=-.60
END
REMARK ARG=d1.x,d1.y d1.x=.99 d1.y=-.45
END
\endverbatim

Notice that one can also use RMSD frames in place of arguments like those above.
