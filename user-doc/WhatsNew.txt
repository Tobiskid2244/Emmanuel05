\section NewFeatures List of new features

- Input file (plumed.dat) syntax is much more flexible and has more 
  error checking. Units are treated
  consistently, so that the plumed.dat file can be ported from on
  MD code to another.
- PLUMED is now compiled as a library, independently of the MD code.
  This simplifies the patching procedure. Moreover, on systems where
  this is possible, PLUMED library will be loaded runtime. This will
  allow updating PLUMED without recompiling or relinking the MD code.
- Interfacing with MD codes is simpler. Hopefully, in the future, these
  interface will be maitained by the developers of the MD codes
  independently from PLUMED developers. This will allow more MD codes
  to be compatible with PLUMED.
- It is now possible to develop and release collective variables,
  free energy methods and other addons independently from PLUMED
  developers. This will allow more collective variables and
  free energy methods to be available.
- Correction to the virial is computed so that constant pressure simulations
  are possible.
- Centers of mass can be used as if they were extra virtual atoms. Thus,
  they can be used in any CV (e.g. also in RMSD, coordination, etc.).
- Different collective variables can be printed on different output files
  and with a different stride. Moreover, variables are not computed on the
  steps on which they are not necessary. This allows for more flexible
  analysis (e.g. rarely computed heavy variables combined with often computed
  light variables).
- And many others...

Caveats:
- PLUMED 2 input file (plumed.dat) has a syntax which is not
  compatible with PLUMED 1.
  Transition should be easy, but cannot
  be done just using the new version with the old input file.
- PLUMED 2 is written in C++, thus requires a C++ compiler
- PLUMED 2 may not include all the features that were available
  in PLUMED 1.

A tutorial explaining how to move from PLUMED 1 to PLUMED 2 is available (see \ref moving).
